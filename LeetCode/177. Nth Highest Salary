QUESTIONS: 177. Nth Highest Salary
Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the nth highest salary where n = 2 is 200. If there is no nth highest salary, then the query should return null.

+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+


CODE:
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  RETURN (
     SELECT CASE WHEN N>COUNT(*) THEN null else MIN(SALARY) end FROM (SELECT DISTINCT SALARY FROM EMPLOYEE ORDER BY SALARY DESC LIMIT N) A    
  );
END
